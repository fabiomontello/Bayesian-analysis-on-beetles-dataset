# Bayesian-analysis-over-beetles-dataset
This work is a full Bayesian analysis, over data regarding the death of beetles after exposure of different concentration of carbondisulphide. The aim of this work is to figure out which of the three proposed models is the best for the given data. 
The binary dose-response data used in this work is the one published by Bliss (1935) and analyzed by Dobson (1983) and represent the number of beetles killed after 5 hours exposure to carbon disulphide at N = 8 different concentrations.
